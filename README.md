# EDA-on-Titanic-Dataset


1. **Data Overview**:
   - Initial dataset structure and column descriptions.
   - Identified missing values and handled them appropriately.

2. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Explored distributions of key numerical variables like `Age`, `Fare`.
   - Analyzed categorical variables like `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Embarked`.

3. **Missing Data Handling**:
   - Visualized missing data and addressed missing values (e.g., `Age`, `Cabin`).

4. **Bivariate Analysis**:
   - Investigated relationships between features (e.g., `Pclass` and `Survived`).
   - Explored survival rates based on `Sex`, `Pclass`, and `Family Size`.

5. **Correlations**:
   - Correlation matrix and heatmap to understand relationships between numerical features.

6. **Visualizations**:
   - Created various plots (bar plots, histograms, heatmaps) to understand data trends and patterns.

7. **Key Insights**:
   - Identified key factors affecting survival, such as gender, class, and family size.
